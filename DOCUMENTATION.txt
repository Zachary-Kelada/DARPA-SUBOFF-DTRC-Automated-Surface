The Geometry is created in Blocks 
1. Bare Hull
2. Sail
3. Tail
4. RingWing

This Is general Steps Guide
1.run the MATLAB Code which will generate the Surface Points at the accuracy you specify (Default is 60 point per Part Length)
2.go to matlab working directory where you will find (x,y,z) points created as CSV File 
3.Import the file to Rhino
4.Use Grasshoper code to create a surface from points in Rhino

For Creating the BareHull
