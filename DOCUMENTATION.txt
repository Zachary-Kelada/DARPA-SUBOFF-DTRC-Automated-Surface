The Geometry is created in Blocks 
1. Bare Hull
2. Sail
3. Tail
4. RingWing

This Is general Steps Guide
1.run the MATLAB Code which will generate the Surface Points at the accuracy you specify (Default is 60 point per Part Length)
2.go to matlab working directory where you will find (x,y,z) points created as CSV File 
3.Import the file to Rhino
4.Use Grasshoper code to create a surface from points in Rhino

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
			Warning
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
the coordinates got decimal values Rhio automatically sets decimals to 4 decmials
1.Make sure to set Units to Feet & Absolute Tolerance to 0.000001 at least

the MATLAB Code Calls Function exportXYZtoCSV make sure "exportXYZtoCSV.mlx" is in the MATLAB working directory
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

For Creating the BareHull
A.Matlab
1.Run MATLAB/DARPA-SUBOFF-HULL.mlx
2.Check your MATLAB working directory and change it to folder you want the CSV Files created
3.(optional,Default is 60) change DivisionBow,DivisionsParallel,DivisionsAft variables using slider in Live Editor

B.Rhino
1.Create Rhino File and Import "XYZ_data_BareHull.csv" generated by the MATLAB Code in MATLAB working Directory
2.in command window type command (seldup) "selects duplicate points that might cause errors" then press delete
3.in Rhino Select all points using (selpt) command or manually

C.Grasshopper
1.in Rhino type Command Grasshopper and open "Grasshopper/BareHull.gh"
2.Right click Point Node and select "Set Multiple Points" at the left end of the workflow
3.Right click "Hull" surface Node and select "Bake" at the right end of the workflow

For Creating the Sail
A.Matlab
1.Run MATLAB/SailSide.mlx
2.Check your MATLAB working directory and change it to folder you want the CSV Files created
3.(optional,Default is 60) change DivisionsSailFore,DivisionsSailParallel,DivisionsSailAft variables using slider in Live Editor
4.Repeat for MATLAB/SailCap.mlx

B.Rhino
1.Create Rhino File and Import "XYZ_data_SailSide.csv" generated by the MATLAB Code "SailSide.mlx" in MATLAB working Directory
2.in command window type command (seldup) "selects duplicate points that might cause errors" then press delete
3.in Rhino Select all points using (selpt) command or manually

C.Grasshopper
1.in Rhino type Command Grasshopper and open "Grasshopper/SailSide.gh"
2.Right click Point Node (at the left end of the workflow) and select "Set Multiple Points" 
3.Right click "Sail Side" surface Node (at the right end of the workflow) and select "Bake"

D.Rhino 
1.change Objects Layer, Hide, or Delete for the created Points to run next script with sail Cap points 
2.Import "XYZ_data_Cap_fore.csv","XYZ_data_Cap_middle.csv" and "XYZ_data_Cap_aft.csv" generated by the MATLAB Code "SailCap.mlx" in MATLAB working Directory
3.in command window type command (seldup) "selects duplicate points that might cause errors" then press delete
4.in Rhino Select all points using (selpt) command or manually

E.Grasshopper
1.in Rhino type Command Grasshopper and open "Grasshopper/SailCap.gh"
2.

4.Right "click Sail Cap" surface Node and select "Bake"
